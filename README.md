# Facial Recognition using Raspberry PI

## Introduction to Today's Workshop

Facial Recognition is one of the most common uses of Pattern Recognition and is AI at its most common form. A facial recognition system is most used for security purposes, with the most advanced version being launched by Smartphone manufacturers in recent months. <br/>

#### Examples of Facial recognition application in use
- Facial motion capture <br/>

Facial motion capture is the process of electronically converting the movements of a person's face into a digital database using cameras or laser scanners. This database may then be used to produce CG (computer graphics) computer animation for movies, games, or real-time avatars. Because the motion of CG characters is derived from the movements of real people, it results in more realistic and nuanced computer character animation than if the animation were created manually. <br/>

- Iphone X <br/> 

Apple released the iPhone X in 2017, advertising face recognition as one of it’s primary new features. The face recognition system in the phone is used for device security. The new model of iPhone sold out almost instantly, proving that consumers now accept facial recognition as the new gold standard for security. <br/>

- Social media <br/>

**Facebook:** Beginning in 2010, Facebook began implementing facial recognition functionality that helped identify people whose faces may be featured in the photos that Facebook users update daily. While the feature was instantly controversial with the news media, sparking a slew of privacy-related articles, Facebook users at large did not seem to mind. Having no apparent negative impact on the website’s usage or popularity, more than 350 million photos are uploaded and tagged using face recognition each day. <br/>

**Snapchat:** At the most basic level, the app uses computer vision to spot you based on contrast patterns typically seen in and around a human face; however, that’s not specific enough to identify, for example, the border of your lips or where to put that dog nose. To get to that level of specificity, Snapchat trained the system using hundreds (quite possibly thousands) of faces that were manually marked with points to show where the borders of lips, eyes, nose, and face are. <br/>
